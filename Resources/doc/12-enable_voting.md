Step 12: Enable voting
==============================================


### Setup Classes
The RJMCommentBundle supports both Doctrine ODM (mongodb) and Doctrine ORM by
default. However, you must provide a concrete Vote class. Follow
the appropriate instructions to set up the classes:

- [Doctrine ORM](12a-mapping_orm.md)
- [Doctrine ODM (mongodb)](12b-mapping_mongodb.md)

### Integration with rjmuserbundle
- [Integration with RJMUserBundle](12c-integration_with_rjmuserbundle.md)

## That is it!
[Return to the index.](index.md)
